## Overview

Medical Test Manager is a full-stack distributed system that enables storage, management, and secure access to medical test data such as patient records, hospitals, doctors, and test results (including DICOM-like imaging). Built on a microservices architecture, it ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

It includes:
- Role-based secure access via Keycloak
- Microservices for core domains (patients, doctors, hospitals, tests)
- RESTful APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- Centralized configuration and service discovery

## Features

- Secure microservices with OAuth2/JWT-based authentication
- CRUD operations for Patients, Doctors, Hospitals, and Medical Tests
- Amazon S3 integration for uploading and retrieving medical images/files
- Docker-based deployment
- OpenAPI (Swagger UI) documentation
- Modular architecture following clean code principles
- Integrated unit testing across services
