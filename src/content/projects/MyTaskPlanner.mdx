## Overview

**My Task Planner** is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage tasks, checklists, and personal productivity.  
It is composed of two main components:  

- **My Task Planner - Backend**: A Spring Bootâ€“powered RESTful API that handles user authentication, task and sprint management, and data persistence. It exposes secure endpoints for clients to create, read, update, and delete tasks and related resources, following modern Java development best practices.  

- **My Task Planner - Frontend**: An Angular-based single-page application that provides a clean and dynamic user interface. It allows users to authenticate, manage boards, and interact seamlessly with the backend API.  

Together, these components form a robust, maintainable, and extensible task management platform.
