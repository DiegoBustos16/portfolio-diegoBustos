## Overview

**Design Pattern Collection** is an educational project containing Java implementations of the classic *Gang of Four* (GoF) design patterns.  
Each pattern is illustrated through motorsport-themed examples—race cars, engineers, strategies, and control centers—to make the concepts more intuitive and engaging.  

Patterns are organized by category:

### Creational Patterns
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/abstractFactory/AbstractFactory.md)
- [Factory Method](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/factory/Factory.md)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/prototype/Prototype.md)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/creational/singleton/Singleton.md)

### Structural Patterns
- [Decorator](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/decorator/Decorator.md)
- [Facade](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/facade/Facade.md)
- [Proxy](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/proxy/Proxy.md)
- [Adapter](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/structural/adapter/Adapter.md)

### Behavioral Patterns
- [Command](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/command/Command.md)
- [Memento](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/memento/Memento.md)
- [Observer](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/observer/Observer.md)
- [Strategy](https://github.com/DiegoBustos16/design-patterns-collection/blob/main/src/main/java/com/diegobustos/design_patterns_collection/behavioral/strategy/Strategy.md)

This repository is intended purely for learning and personal reference, with well-documented code to help others understand and apply design patterns effectively.
