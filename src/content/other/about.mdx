I'm Diego Bustos, a Full Stack Developer specialized in building robust backends with Java & Spring Boot and modern interfaces with React and Tailwind CSS. My experience spans from designing scalable RESTful APIs and optimizing PostgreSQL queries to working with Docker, CI/CD, and secure authentication flows.

I value clean, maintainable code and enjoy contributing both in agile teams and independent projects. Being a wheelchair user has shaped my perspective on accessibility, resilience, and thoughtful problem-solving, which I bring into every solution I develop.
