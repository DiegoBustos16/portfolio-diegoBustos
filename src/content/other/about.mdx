I'm Diego Bustos, a backend-oriented fullstack developer with a strong focus on Java and Spring Boot. I enjoy designing clean, maintainable systems and have been applying these skills to a real-world medical study management platform.

My work includes building secure microservices, integrating JWT-based authentication with Keycloak, and crafting well documented APIs using Swagger and Docker.

I approach software with a mindset shaped by real-world constraints â€” being a wheelchair user has naturally made me more thoughtful about accessibility, reliability, and edge cases.

Above all, I love building tools that are practical, elegant, and grounded in real use.
